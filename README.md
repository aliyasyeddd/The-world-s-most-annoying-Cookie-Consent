> 😂 Annoying Popup Simulator — A mischievous web app that mimics the internet’s most frustrating popups, complete with unreachable buttons and a cheeky laugh when you finally give in!

---

## 🪞 Overview  
This fun little web app recreates the internet’s most annoying popup experience — just when you’re focused, it interrupts you asking for your name and email. It’s designed for learners and developers exploring form handling, CSS tricks, and DOM manipulation. What makes it unique (and hilarious) is how the decline button keeps dodging your clicks, only to reveal at the end that your data is being “sold” — and it even laughs at you! Along the way, you’ll practice setTimeout, event.preventDefault(), formData, CSS row-reverse, toggling classes, and more.
